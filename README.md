  ## 1.1	Business question
  ####  Business Questions
### The Marketing Department needs to classify the segments of each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

  ## 1.2	Dataset
  #### Dataset includes 4 different  related tables including: transaction information, products information, returned orders of customers purchasing products from 2014 to 2017 and RFM classification 
  ## 1.3	Method: RFM analysis
  ### What is RFM?
Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a firm’s best clients based on the nature of their spending habits. An RFM analysis evaluates clients and customers by scoring them in three categories: how recently they’ve made a purchase, how often they buy, and the size of their purchases.

  ### Significance of RFM?
RFM analysis allows a comparison between potential contributors and clients. It gives organizations a sense of how much revenue comes from repeat customers (vs. new customers), and which levers they can pull to try to make customers happier so they become repeat purchasers.

  #### Recency
The more recently a customer has made a purchase with a company, the more likely they will continue to keep the business and brand in mind for subsequent purchases. Compared with customers who have not bought from the business in months or even longer periods, the likelihood of engaging in future transactions with recent customers is arguably higher.
Such information can be used to get recent customers to revisit the business and spend more. In an effort not to overlook lapsed customers, marketing efforts might be made to offer them an incentive to resume buying.

  #### Frequency
The frequency of a customer’s transactions may be affected by factors such as the type of product, the price point for the purchase, and the need for replenishment or replacement. If the purchase cycle can be predicted—for example, when a customer needs to buy more groceries—marketing efforts may be directed toward reminding them to visit the business when staple items run low.
  #### Monetary
Monetary value stems from how much the customer spends. A natural inclination is to put more emphasis on encouraging customers who spend the most money to continue to do so. While this can produce a better return on investment (ROI) in marketing and customer service, it also runs the risk of alienating customers who have been consistent but may not spend as much with each transaction.

# II.Insights
### 1.The most important index of the 3 indicators that the SuperStore company needs to pay attention to is F, then R: because the rate of customers buying once and twice is very high. Very few customers make long-term purchases like 8-9 times or more. -> That shows that the customer retention rate at the company is still low.
### 2.About Customer Segmentation: The company is mainly "New Customers" >"Hibernating customers">"Lost customers". -> This again shows that we need to pay attention to the index F.
### 3.Revenue and profit from "New Customers" is the highest.
### 4.The revenue in the East region is the lowest compared to the other 3 regions.
### 5.California, Texas, Illinois vs Florida are the states with the most orders.
### 6.The company's main customers are Consumers accounting for 52%, Corporate: 30% and finally Home Office.
### 7.The categories with the most orders are "Office Supplies" up to 60%, then "Furniture".
### 8.The main subcategory are: Paper(14%), Binders(15%), Art(9%), Phones and Storage (8%).

# IV. Recommendations
## The company needs to have policies to:
### Retaining new customers:
#### For new customers who have made a recent purchase, send a personalized welcome email or offer that thanks them for their purchase and encourages them to return to our business.
#### For customers who have made only one purchase, use email marketing to keep them engaged with our brand and encourage them to make a second purchase.
#### Offer a special discount or promotion to incentivize them to return.
#### For customers who have made a high-value purchase, thank them for their business and offer a loyalty program that rewards them for their continued purchases.
### Promoting hibernating customers:
#### For hibernating customers who have not made a purchase in a while, send a win-back email or offer that encourages them to return to our business.
#### Offer a special discount or promotion that is personalized based on their past purchases.
#### For customers who have made multiple purchases in the past but have not made one recently, send personalized email campaigns that showcase new products or services that may be of interest to them.
#### For high-value customers who have not made a purchase in a while, send a personalized email or offer that highlights new products or services that may be of interest to them and offer a special discount or promotion that is tailored to their past purchase history.
#### Need to have a marketing strategy to focus on the segment: Consumer -> Office Supplies segment in states like California, Texas, and Illinois vs Florida.
